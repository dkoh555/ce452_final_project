Notes:
Optimized code improves GPU performance by creating cache-friendly memory layouts with torch.stack, keeping computations on-device to eliminate PCIe transfers, leveraging vectorized operations for SIMD execution, reducing memory overhead through efficient allocation and storage, and organizing tensor dimensions to better match GPU's parallel processing architecture.; while maintaining compatibility with the rest of Genesis by converting the result back to NumPy.
